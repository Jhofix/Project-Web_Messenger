# Chat Website
A secure chat website for teams and staffs of organizations


# Team
Name: Dada Joshua
Role: Frontend and backend
Purpose: To experiment with the capabilities of the backend and the frontend to communicate flawlessly to generate more dynamic web pages that are active in real time using API technologies.


# Technologies
Database: MySQL
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Express.js
Others: Socket.io

MongoDB is a great alternative database to consider for this project. However, due to the more structured nature of MySQL considering future needs in terms of database-side data processing and capabilities that may arise as the project expands, MySQL has been selected

We have selected socket.io over SOCK js because it sets out to offer a general purpose realtime messaging solution, whereas SockJS aims to emulate the WebSocket API.


# Challenge Statement
To overcome the problems associated with internal communications among team members and staff members of any organization or closed group, a secure and well designed medium is required.
This project uses the right tools to implement a safe environment to ensure that team members can communicate with other team members without any risk of information leak in any form.

This project is focused on official communication to help organizations keep their members informed. Therefore, it does not include some social media messaging features such as discovering new people, creating social pages or reading channel news and other such features available on the social media messaging platforms.

However, business owners, corporate organizations, members of corporate teams and other related user groups will benefit greatly from the implementation of this project as it will provide them with a simple and precise interface that helps them manage their team communications in one single space.

This project is especially useful to corporate entities or organizations and is not limited to any specific geographic region except regions which government policies may not support the use of such websites.


# Risks
Due to the nature of the information involved in the use of this project, a major potential risk is data leak or penetration by intruders to break team communication and retrieve data. This is a major concern in this project because it may break the trust of users in this project and discontinue their usage of the website. Therefore, this project relies on secure communication between the backend and front end using HTTPS and secure sockets layer (SSL)


# Infrastructure
Since this is a project intended to be handled by a single developer, all the various aspects of the code will be tested and debugged locally before being pushed to github

Functionality and performance testing will be carried out locally using command line tools and browser developer tools while the interface will be further tested by loading the project website on different devices.


# Existing Solutions
Slack: The slack project is one similar product that focuses mainly on team or corporate communications and incorporates a wider variety of features. While the slack project has implemented various features beyond the scope of this project, the main emphasis is still based on team chats and file sharing
